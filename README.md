# Blockchain-plus

The ultimate library to tackle the biggest software problem of all:

What is the best way to verarschen the Bundesregierung to buy your shit with Steuergelder?

Well, don't worry anymore! Blockchain-plus can add as many private blockchains to your software as you want.

All you have to do is to require and call this module with the number of blockchains you need:

```js
const blockchainPlus = require('blockchain-plus');
let blockchains = blockchainPlus(1000); // <- creates 1000 blockchains!!!
```

## Test suite

The library even comes with a fully fledged test suite!

Yes, you have richtig gelesen! Watch and staune:

```sh
% npm test

> blockchain-plus@1.0.0 test
> node test.js

Yes, it works! ðŸ¥¦
(verified with a high security certification broccoli)

## We put AI in blockch-AI-n

Since version 2.0, each blockchain also contains an AI. These AIs are neural networks (single-layer perceptrons) that have been individually trained on exceptionally entropic data.

```js
console.log(blockchains[0])
[
	â€¦
  '16eca9e6e1ee06574b770345f92e0daa1632400f1b14efe57bc36818c80fcd11',
  â€¦
  AI: {
    fit: [Function],
    transform: [Function],
    fit_transform: [Function],
    fit_random: [Function],
    error: [Function],
    learn: [Function]
  }
]
